This folder contains an example run for force matching in AMBER.
Calculation inputs are ported from 001_water_tutorial which
uses Gromacs as an engine.

Instructions for setting up target:
1) A .mol2 and .frcmod file for the molecule are created.
   These need to be given to "forcefield" in FB input file.
   The files need to be placed in the "forcefield" folder.
   These files are basically created by hand.

2) In each target, all.gro is converted to all.mdcrd and conf.pdb.
   The virtual site is deleted because the sander API doesn't
   support virtual site calculations with igb>0.
   (Although igb 6 should be fine in principle...
    sent email to AMBER mailing list)
   all.mdcrd contains all of the coordinates in text .mdcrd format,
   but any format readable by forcebalance.Molecule is usable.
   (Need to support netcdf in single point energy / force because
    Molecule does not read netcdf yet.)
   conf.pdb should contain just one frame and is used to
   provide topology information.
   A python script convert.py is used to do the conversion.

3) Each target also contains qdata.txt (copied straight from
   001_water_tutorial) and setup.leap.  I've found that the
   most onerous step is actually getting tleap to assign the
   structures in the pdb to the residue template.  Lessons:
   - When loading the mol2 file as a molecule, the molecule
     name must match the residue name in the PDB (case sensitive)
   - When editing the mol2 atoms and bonds by hand, make sure
     the Natoms/Nbonds record numbers are changed as well.
     Otherwise leap will fail to read the mol2 file and there
     will be a "residue not recognized" error.
