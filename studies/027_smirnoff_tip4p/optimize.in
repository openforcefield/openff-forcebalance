# ForceBalance input file generated by MakeInputFile.py
# The octothorpe '#' is a comment symbol
# There are two sections, the main options ($options) and the target options ($target)
# A ForceBalance calculation will have one $options section and as one $target section per optimization target
# The most important options are listed at the top; options are also roughly grouped by their application
# Note: If the specified value is 'None' then the option will truly be set to None - not the string 'None'
# Note: Section option types are more complicated and may require you to read the documentation
# Note: Boolean option types require no value, the key being present implies 'True'
# Note: List option types are specified using spaces as the delimiter - i.e. forcefield ff1.itp ff2.itp ; delete empty brackets before use []
