Note: This is just a test-study meant to show that ForceBalance is able to use
the AbInitio_SMIRNOFF target to parameterize molecules with virtual sites.
It is not recommended to actually use this, as fitting to conformational energies isn't
likely to reproduce an accurate polarizability for the Drude particles.

Note: This test is based upon the existing 026_drude_water test study.
